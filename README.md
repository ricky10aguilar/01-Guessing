# 01-Guessing
 This is my first C220 project: a guessing game, wtritten with Python. The point of this game is to teach me about simple data types and control structures.
 
 The players is asked to give their name and is then followed by a request to guess a number between 1 and 100. THe player can guess as many times as they need to get the random number right. In the end the game reports the total amount of attempts.
